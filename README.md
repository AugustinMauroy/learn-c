# Learn-C

My learning of C language. I'm learning C at school, so I'm just putting my code here.

## Note:

Ansii color code for terminal:

| Color | Code |
|-------|------|
| Black | \033[0;30m |
| Red | \033[0;31m |
| Green | \033[0;32m |
| Yellow | \033[0;33m |
| Blue | \033[0;34m |
| Purple | \033[0;35m |
| Cyan | \033[0;36m |
| White | \033[0;37m |

Usage of UTF-8 characters:

```c
printf("\u03A9\n"); // => Î©
```

> [!NOTE]
> The code above need to be compiled with LLVM. And the terminal must support UTF-8.
